# Kustomize Manifest Validation

GitHub Actions TypeScript action to validate Kustomize project manifests.

## Description

This action validates Kustomize projects by running `kustomize build` on each discovered project to ensure they can generate valid Kubernetes manifests.

## Prerequisites

- Kustomize CLI must be installed and available in PATH
- A `kustomize-listing.yaml` file must exist (generated by the kustomize-listing action)

## Features

- Validates Kustomize projects using `kustomize build`
- Provides detailed validation results in GitHub Actions summary
- Supports configuration via `.ci.config.yaml` files
- Handles both `kustomization.yaml` and `kustomization.yml` files

## Validation Process

1. Reads the kustomize listing file to find all Kustomize projects
2. For each project, runs `kustomize build <directory>`
3. Reports success/failure status for each project
4. Generates a comprehensive summary table

## Output

Creates a GitHub Actions summary with:
- ✅ Successfully validated projects
- ⚠️ Projects with empty output
- ❌ Projects that failed validation
- :heavy_exclamation_mark: Projects with validation disabled

## Usage

This package is designed to be used as part of a larger GitHub Actions workflow for Kustomize project management, typically after running the kustomize-listing action.

## Dependencies

- @actions/core
- @actions/github
- yaml
- child_process (for running kustomize command)
